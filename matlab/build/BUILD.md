# Building the Matlab binary

The Matlab binary is already present in the repository in the
../bin directory. To recreate it from the Matlab code in ../src,
SPM12 r7771 must be installed in the ../src/spm12_r7771 subdirectory:
https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/
The script compile_matlab.sh produces the Matlab binary.
